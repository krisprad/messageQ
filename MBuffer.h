//! Ring buffer management class with number of rows and number of columns per row.

//! Buffer has a total of TRows x TColumns elements. 
// The ring buffer size is TRows with
// each row now representing TColumns.
// The same buffer can be reconfigured as different number of rows and 
// columns as long as their product equals the original number of elements.
// A producer acquires an entire row synchronously and writes all values in
// the row in one go. A consumer in turn acquires an entire row synchronously and
// reads all the values in one go. This reduces synchronization costs, significantly 
// increasing throughput.

	// A ring buffer location can be associated with only one absolute location
	// from the point it is produced, until it is consumed.
	// Once elements in x which is mapped to in x + m_rows are produced and consumed,
	// the same x is mapped to x + 2*m_rows for subsequent use by producer.
	// Thus the mapping is to chronologically increasing values.
	// This map is to establish what is expected at any particular point.
	// When a producer or consumer is processing a ring buffer location, 
	// its corresponding  map location should not change.
	// Otherwise a producer and a consumer can see different values in the same
	// location they are accessing.
	// This map is written to by a producer:
	// For eg. a producer writes a value in ring buffer x and specifies in the map
	// what absoute location that the value is for.
	// It is GetNextLocForCons responsibility to ensure that
	// the buf loc they are seeking to consume refers to the same absolute
	// location producer wrote, and did not change absolute location
	// by the time they return the location to the caller. This map is used for that.
